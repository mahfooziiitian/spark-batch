# Duplicate column

Sometimes there is an unexpected issue that comes up after joining two DataFrames with one or more columns that have the same name.

When this happens, the joined DataFrame would have multiple columns with the same name.

In this situation, it is not easy to refer to one of those columns while performing some kind of transformation on the joined DataFrame.
