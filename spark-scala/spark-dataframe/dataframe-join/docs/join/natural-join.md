# Natural join

Natural joins make implicit guesses at the columns on which you would like to join.
It finds matching columns and returns the results.
Left, right, and outer natural joins are all supported.
A natural join is a type of equi join that occurs implicitly by comparing all the same names columns in both tables.
The join result has only one column for each pair of equally named columns.
In other words, the Natural Join helps to join the two tables based on the same attribute name and the
data types.
The result of the JOIN table will contain all the attributes of both tables but keep only one copy of each common
column accordingly.
