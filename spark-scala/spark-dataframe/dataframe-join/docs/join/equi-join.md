# Equi join

Equi join is a special type of join in which we use only an equality operator.
Hence, when you make a query for join using equality operator, a then that join query comes under
Equi join.
The equi join creates a JOIN for equality or matching of the single or multiple column values of
the relative tables.
Apart from that, the equi join also creates the JOIN by using JOIN along with the ON clause and then
providing the names of the columns with their relative tables to check equality using the equal
operator.
An equi-join is a possible type of inner-joins.
