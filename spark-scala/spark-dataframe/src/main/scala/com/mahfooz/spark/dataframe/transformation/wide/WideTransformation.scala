/*

A wide dependency (or wide transformation) style transformation will have input partitions contributing to many
output partitions.
You will often hear this referred to as a shuffle whereby Spark will exchange partitions across the cluster.
With narrow transformations, Spark will automatically perform an operation called pipelining, meaning that if we
specify multiple filters on DataFrames, theyâ€™ll all be performed in-memory.
The same cannot be said for shuffles.
When we perform a shuffle, Spark writes the results to disk.
