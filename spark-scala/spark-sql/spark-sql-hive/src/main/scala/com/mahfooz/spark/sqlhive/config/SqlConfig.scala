/*
Hive comes packaged with the Spark library as HiveContext that inherits from
SQLContext.
Utilizing HiveContext, you can create and find tables in the HiveMetaStore and write
queries on it using HiveQL.
When hive-site.xml is not configured, the context automatically produces a metastore
named as metastore_db and a folder known as warehouse in the current directory.
