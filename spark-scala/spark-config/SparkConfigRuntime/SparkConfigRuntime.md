If this is specified, the profile result will not be displayed automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If the memory used during aggregation goes above this amount, it will spill the data into disks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| spark.python.worker.reuse	                    | true                   | 	Reuse Python worker or not. If yes, it will use a fixed number of Python workers, does not need to fork() a Python process for every tasks. It will be very useful if there is large broadcast, then the broadcast will not be needed to transferred from JVM to Python worker for every task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
