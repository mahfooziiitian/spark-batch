/*
You can create rows by manually instantiating a Row object with the values that belong in each column
Itâ€™s important to note that only DataFrames have schemas. Rows themselves do not have schemas.
This means that if you create a Row manually, you must specify the values in the same order as the schema of the DataFrame to which they might be appended.
