You can monitor the progress of a job through the Spark web UI.
The Spark UI is available on port 4040 of the driver node.
If you are running in local mode, this will be http://localhost:4040.
The Spark UI displays information on the state of your Spark jobs, its environment, and cluster state.
Itâ€™s very useful, especially for tuning and debugging.
