First of all, it has to be understood that it doesn't matter if a DataFrame, the Dataset API, or
SQL is used. They all result in the same Unresolved Logical Execution Plan (ULEP).
A QueryPlan is unresolved if the column names haven't been verified and the column types haven't been looked up in the catalog.
