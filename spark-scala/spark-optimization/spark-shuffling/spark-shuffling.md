# spark.sql.shuffle.partitions

Spark uses a technique called shuffle to move data between its executors or nodes while performing operations such as join, union, groupby, and reduceby.

The shuffle operation is very expensive as it involves the movement of data between nodes.

Hence, it is usually preferable to reduce the amount of shuffle involved in a Spark query. The number of partition splits that Spark performs while shuffling data is determined by the following configuration:

    spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions",200)

Created during operations like groupBy() or join(), also known as wide transformations, shuffle partitions consume both network and disk I/O resources.

If you have too much data and too few partitions, this might result in longer tasks. But, on the other hand, if you have too little data and too many shuffle partitions, the overhead of shuffle tasks will degrade performance.


During these operations, the shuffle will spill results to executors’ local disks at the location specified in 
    
    spark.local.directory

Having performant SSD disks for this operation will boost the performance.

There is no magic formula for the number of shuffle partitions to set for the shuffle stage; the number may vary depending on your use case, data set, number of cores, and the amount of executor memory available—it’s a trial-and-error approach.
