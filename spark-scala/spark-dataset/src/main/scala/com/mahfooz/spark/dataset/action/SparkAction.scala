/*

Transformations allow us to build up our logical transformation plan.
To trigger the computation, we run an action.
An action instructs Spark to compute a result from a series of transformations.
There are three kinds of actions:

  a)  Actions to view data in the console
  b)  Actions to collect data to native objects in the respective language
  c)  Actions to write to output data sources
