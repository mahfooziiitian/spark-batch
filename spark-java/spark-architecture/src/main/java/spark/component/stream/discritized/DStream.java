/*

Apache Spark Discretized Stream is the key abstraction of Spark Streaming. That is what we call Spark DStream. Basically, it represents a stream of data divided into small batches. Moreover, DStreams are built on Spark RDDs, Sparkâ€™s core data abstraction. It also allows Streaming to seamlessly integrate with any other Apache Spark components. Such as Spark MLlib and Spark SQL.
